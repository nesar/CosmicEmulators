# CosmicEmulators

## Python codes related to halo mass function emulators
1. The gaussian process emulator is trained based on semi-analytical models of halo mass function. 
2. Emulator coverges to reasonable error for arbitrary values of 5 cosmological parameters. 
2. Calibration problem is unresolved so far: doesn't seem to converge yet.
